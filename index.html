            My name is Jake Pasternak and this is a bit about me and the work
            I've done.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was born in San Diego, California, and raised in Mililani, Hawaii,
            from the age of 3 years old. Technology has been a growing interest
            of mine since early childhood. I can remember as young as preschool
            age being given an old VCR player and a screw driver to keep myself
            busy for the recess. Since then, education by deconstruction has
            been a hobby, and frankly a great way to de-stress.
          </p>
          <p>
            My high school alma mater is Mililani High School, and during my
            time there I had the great opportunity to work alongside the
            school's network administrator as a Student Tech. From early on in
            my formal education, I was exposed to technical concepts and
            knowledge I still use today. A+ computer hardware and software,
            Cisco networking, and python programming were a part of courses I
            took as early as my freshman year in high school. After graduating
            and working for a few years, I went back to school to complete and
            Associates degree in Computer, Security, and Networking Technologies
            (CSNT) from Honolulu Community College.

              >Check out the CSNT program</a
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Since graduating, I've been working at Hawaii Medical Service
            Association (HMSA) in Honolulu, Hawaii, as a Project Administrator.
            In this role, I've managed multiple projects and initiatives related
            to infrastructure technologies. Included in these initiatives is a
            project involving the transition of the entire organization (about
            1800 staff and contractors) from Windows 7 to Windows 10. I managed
            the scheduling and planning, knowledge production and distribution,
            and communications related to incidents or general inquiries. For
            this project, I leveraged my knowledge of PowerShell to write a
            script that pulls active users from AD, parses through them, and
            creates deployment groups of less than 50, grouped by manager.
          </p>
          <p>
            After reading above, it might be curious to some as to why I've made
            the switch from an infrastructure-based, project role to a more
            technical, application developer one. A few factors drive my
            decision:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A desire to move out of Hawaii</li>
            <li>A burning interest in coding and development</li>
            <li>A curiousity to challenge myself with something new.</li>
            <li>The writing on the wall...</li>
          </ul>
          <p>What I mean by "writing on the wall" is twofold.</p>
          <p>
            The first aspect of it is my internal feelings about my skills and
            aptitudes. When I was younger, first growing in my knowledge and
            experience of computers and technology, I began to get this natural
            sensation of a knack for what I was doing. Wether it had been
            helping my parents fix some issue with their computers to
            troubleshooting my own machines by apparent intuition. It just came
            naturally, and I get the same feeling about coding. I simply
            <em>get</em> what's going on in the computer and the programs I work
            with. Why not dig deeper and start writing them?
          </p>
          <p>
            The second aspect is likely more obvious to everyone: tech is
            growing. It's growing in this country, it's growing around the
            world, and there's a growing need for people who want to code the
            world into the future. Aside from my personal interests, I have a
            bit of altruism in me that wants to put my talent's and affinities
            to good use. I have ideas, I have drive, and I want to make
            everyone's lives easier. That way we can get back to what we enjoy
            doing, which isn't figuring out why our application isn't working
            right.
