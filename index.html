            <p>
              My name is Jake Pasternak and this is a bit about me and the work
              I've done.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was born in San Diego, California, and raised in Mililani,
              Hawaii, from the age of 3 years old. Technology has been a growing
              interest of mine since early childhood. I can remember as young as
              preschool age being given an old VCR player and a screw driver to
              keep myself busy for the recess. Since then, education by
              deconstruction has been a hobby, and frankly a great way to
              de-stress.
            </p>
            <p>
              My high school alma mater is Mililani High School, and during my
              time there I had the great opportunity to work alongside the
              school's network administrator as a Student Tech. From early on in
              my formal education, I was exposed to technical concepts and
              knowledge I still use today. A+ computer hardware and software,
              Cisco networking, and python programming were a part of courses I
              took as early as my freshman year in high school. After graduating
              and working for a few years, I went back to school to complete and
              Associates degree in Computer, Security, and Networking
              Technologies (CSNT) from Honolulu Community College.

                >Check out the CSNT program</a
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Since graduating, I've been working at Hawaii Medical Service
              Association (HMSA) in Honolulu, Hawaii, as a Project
              Administrator. In this role, I've managed multiple projects and
              initiatives related to infrastructure technologies. Included in
              these initiatives is a project involving the transition of the
              entire organization (about 1800 staff and contractors) from
              Windows 7 to Windows 10. I managed the scheduling and planning,
              knowledge production and distribution, and communications related
              to incidents or general inquiries. For this project, I leveraged
              my knowledge of PowerShell to write a script that pulls active
              users from AD, parses through them, and creates deployment groups
              of less than 50, grouped by manager.
            </p>
            <p>
              After reading above, it might be curious to some as to why I've
              made the switch from an infrastructure-based, project role to a
              more technical, application developer one. A few factors drive my
              decision:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A desire to move out of Hawaii</li>
              <li>A burning interest in coding and development</li>
              <li>A curiousity to challenge myself with something new.</li>
              <li>The writing on the wall...</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What I mean by "writing on the wall" is twofold.</p>
            <p>
              The first aspect of it is my internal feelings about my skills and
              aptitudes. When I was younger, first growing in my knowledge and
              experience of computers and technology, I began to get this
              natural sensation of a knack for what I was doing. Wether it had
              been helping my parents fix some issue with their computers to
              troubleshooting my own machines by apparent intuition. It just
              came naturally, and I get the same feeling about coding. I simply
              <em>get</em> what's going on in the computer and the programs I
              work with. Why not dig deeper and start writing them?
            </p>
            <p>
              The second aspect is likely more obvious to everyone: tech is
              growing. It's growing in this country, it's growing around the
              world, and there's a growing need for people who want to code the
              world into the future. Aside from my personal interests, I have a
              bit of altruism in me that wants to put my talent's and affinities
              to good use. I have ideas, I have drive, and I want to make
              everyone's lives easier. That way we can get back to what we enjoy
              doing, which isn't figuring out why our application isn't working
              right.
